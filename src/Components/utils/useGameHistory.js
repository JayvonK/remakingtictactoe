//Pseudo
//Create a function that returns an object holding 5 elements, an array, a number, a fuction that updates history, another function that resets history, and a function that is used to change the state of the number
//We initialize the state of the array as an array with the length of 9 and that's filled with null
//We initialize the state of the number as 0
//We need the update history function to take in a parameter, then set the array we created to that parameter, and also set the number we created to the parameter's length minus 1
//We need the reset history function to reset the array and integer to it's original values
